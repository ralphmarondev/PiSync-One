# üîê PiSync-One

**PiSync-One** is an all-in-one smart access control system for **my home**.
It enables **family members** to unlock doors via mobile or desktop, while administrators manage users, access logs, and devices
through a native desktop app‚Äîall without needing an internet connection.

Built with **Compose Multiplatform** and **Spring Boot (Kotlin)**, PiSync-One is designed for reliability, offline
capability, and cross-platform performance.
The system also integrates with a **Raspberry Pi** for controlling physical lock hardware and biometric authentication.

## ‚ú® Features

### üßë‚Äçüíº Admin Dashboard (Desktop App)

- View and manage **family members** and rooms
- Review access logs and sync records
- Works fully offline within a local network

### üì± Family Member Mobile App (Android)

- Unlock door remotely (within the network)
- View room status and access logs
- Designed with a modern, responsive UI

### üîê Secure Backend API (Spring Boot)

- Role-based authentication using JWT
- Access control endpoints with admin/**family member** roles
- Built with Kotlin and PostgreSQL

### üì° Raspberry Pi Integration

- Handles physical door unlocking using relays/solenoids
- Integrates optional fingerprint recognition module
- Communicates securely with the backend server over LAN

---

## üîÑ Real-Time Sync & Logging

All access actions are logged with:

- Timestamp
- User identity
- Method (App / Fingerprint / Manual)
- Room ID

Logs sync across platforms when available and are viewable by admins.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ralphmarondev/PiSync-One.git
cd PiSync-One
```

### 2. Run the Backend (Spring Boot)

```bash
cd server
./gradlew bootRun
```

Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
Configure `application.yml` for your local DB setup.

### 3. Run the App (Android/Desktop)

```bash
cd app
# Open in Android Studio
# Select desired target (Android emulator or Desktop app)
```

### 4. Setup Raspberry Pi

- Upload the code from `raspberrypi/`
- Configure GPIO pins for your lock hardware
- Connect fingerprint module if used
- Ensure Pi can access the backend via LAN IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080`)
